# About
This solution makes it easy to add functionality to the GitHub for Visual Studio extension and explore its APIs.

## Quickstart

1. Build the solution

```
> build
```

2. Install the extension

```
> install
```

3. Start development

```
> develop
```

Visual Studio will open with the `GitHub.VisualStudio.Contrib` project in *live* development mode. This means you can make a change, build just this project and immediately try your changes in the running instance of Visual Studio!

You only need to build/install the `GitHub.VisualStudio.Contrib.Vsix` project if you need to add/change menu items.
